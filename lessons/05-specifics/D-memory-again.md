### So lets reduce our memory usage
Memory Pool!
* What is a memory pool (draw it out)
* When can you use one?
* Why would you use one?
* Lets implement a simple one

### What should we memory pool?
Well lets pick out the most common items that we produce, bullets, then we
could do a few more

### How do we know we are faster?
* Lets look at the memory sampler to see if we made progress
* lets look at the ticks per second program and see if we did better

### What the heck... why aren't we faster?
Lets take a look at our performance graph when it comes to gc before we made
our improvements

* Opportunity size matters

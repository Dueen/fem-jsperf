### Two quick things
* We will do optimizations step by step and independently and combine them to see the real value of each change.
* We are using local host to test.  this comes with a series of optimizations and can be a bit misleading.  At the end of the day, real tests should be done in production environments, but that doesn't mean you cannot make a series of great improvements otherwise. (programs running)
    * i do have 3 monitors, and 2 of them driving 4k, i don't know what this will do to results
* We will not be using microbenchmarks throughout this, let me explain

### I am not good at planning
* every step of the way will be in branches available on the remote
- first opt, second opt, third opt
* I don't think the programming is the important part, its fine to just observe

<br/>
<br/>

so if you fall behind or cannot make something work that is fine.

### Welcome
JavaScript Performance, is this an oxymoron?

like all answers, it depends

### Depends on if you have no choice for another language
if you have no choice, there is still fast and slow javascript

### Key Note
This course is as much a "performance" course as its a javascript fundamentals.
If you stick through the whole course you will learn a ton about _HOW_
javascript works

* These are transferrable skills.  Any other GC based language will have similar concepts
* It will make you write better code.  Better code in this case delivers what
  the customer wants but smoother, crispier, and smothered in coconut oil

### What this course is about
This course is as much a "performance" course as its a javascript fundamentals.
If you stick through the whole course you will learn a ton about _HOW_
javascript works

* These are transferrable skills.  Any other GC based language will have similar concepts
  * Its also transferrable between bun and node and the browser
  * We will not talk about the dom today
* It will make you write better code.  Better code in this case delivers what
  the customer wants but smoother, crispier, and smothered in coconut oil

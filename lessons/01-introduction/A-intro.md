### Welcome
JavaScript Performance, is this an oxymoron?

like all answers, it depends

### Speed is relative
* when we say fast...

### What this course is about
This course is as much a "performance" course as its a javascript fundamentals.
If you stick through the whole course you will learn a about _how_
javascript works

* These are transferrable skills.  Any other GC based language will have similar concepts
  * Its also transferrable between bun and node and the browser
  * We will not talk about the dom today
* It will make you write better code.  Better code in this case delivers what
  the customer wants but smoother, crispier, and smothered in coconut oil
* we will not deep dive into `perf` or `chrome-tracing` or `v8-tracing`
* we will talk about "micro" optizimations (property ordering, monomorphism)

### Lets go into the code
a decent amount of javascript, we will move fast, we don't need to be to deep
into the weeds

### The Problem Statement
Internal reports from the CI server has shown that our game doesn't deliver
frames on time.

* On time frame: 15, 16, or 17 ms frames.  This is typescript after all, precision isn't an option
* We expect below 25% frames to over or underflow
* It is your job to fix it, or you don't have a job... and that sucks
* you also want a Christmas bonus, so you want to do a great job.

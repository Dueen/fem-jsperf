### The goals of this course
The goal of this course is to make you better at javascript and to understand
why such a simple piece of syntax such as `{}` has so much weight.

<br>
<br>

But not all fixing of software is going to be this easy.  What we did is
observe and fix, but some software there is no obvious issues.  This is the
problem with code that is written sloppy over the course of many functions

### Sets of tools
* performance and memory tabs are great
* node's async stuff is slow (for now)
* memory is a good indication to where problems are
* GC time a good indicator of issues
* Sets are not always fast

A lot of what we discussed here has been explored on my twitch channel.  so
there is always a chance i'll be doing perf work on twitch if you want to join.
